Description: Methods for inference about relationships between contributors to a DNA mixture and 
  other individuals of known genotype: a basic example would be testing whether a contributor to 
  a mixture is the father of a child of known genotype. Thi si identical to the 'KinMix' package,
  except that the latter uses 'RHugin' as the Bayes net engine, while this package uses 'gRain', with
  a consequent modest reduction in performance.
